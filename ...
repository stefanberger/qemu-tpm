Windows seems to require IRQ 13 for supporting TPM TIS in interrupt mode.
IRQ 13 is an edge interrupt (following /proc/interrupts). Linux TPM TIS
driver does not work with an edge interrupt but needs a level interrupt,
such as provided by IRQ 5. The existing TPM TIS code works with IRQ 5
(module a patch for a bug fix in this series).

If we move to IRQ 13, we loose Linux support (it will try to use it but
operations will stall), and if we move to IRQ 5, Windows cannot access the
TPM at all. So, we're stuck with polling.
